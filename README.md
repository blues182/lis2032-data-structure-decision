## 📌 Overview  
This project implements a **Data Structure Decision System** that guides a user through  
a series of structured questions and produces a **recommended data structure** based on  
the logic covered during the LIS2032 course (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues,  
Binary Trees, Graphs).

The goal is to:  
- Ask the user a set of yes/no input questions  
- Apply formalized **decision rules**  
- Recommend a **single best data structure**  
- Provide:
  - A diagram  
  - A pseudocode snippet  
  - An example seen in class  
  - A final textual explanation (rationale)

All logic is modularized and tested using Python’s `unittest`.

## 🚀 Features  
- Fully modular Python application (`src/`)
- Decision rules in code + documented in `/docs`
- Auto-generated recommendation rationale
- Class-based design for clarity and reuse
- Full test suite under `/test`
- Runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux
- Optional Docker support
