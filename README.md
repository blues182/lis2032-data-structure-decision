## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **guided decision system** written in **C** that recommends the most suitable **data structure** based on a short questionnaire about the user's problem requirements.

The system analyzes the user’s needs (e.g., ordering, random access, priority, LIFO/FIFO behavior, graph relations, etc.) and recommends one of the following structures studied in the LIS2032 course:

- Array  
- Linked List  
- Stack  
- Queue  
- Binary Search Tree (BST)  
- Heap (Priority Queue)  
- Graph  

The system also displays:
- A visual ASCII diagram of the structure  
- Pseudocode of the most relevant operations  
- A course-based example

## 🧠 Learning Objectives
- Identify relevant constraints of a computational problem.  
- Map requirements to appropriate data structures.  
- Justify decisions using algorithmic properties.  
- Communicate structure behavior via diagrams and pseudocode.  
- Implement a modular C program.  
- Apply documentation and version control.
